# Python Automation Projects

Welcome to the Python Automation Projects repository! This repository contains various Python scripts designed to automate common tasks. Each project is self-contained and includes the necessary code and documentation to help you understand and run the scripts.

## Projects

- [macOS Desktop Organizer](./mac-os-desktop-organizer/): The `mac-os-desktop-organizer.py` script helps you organize files on your Mac OS desktop by automatically moving files into designated folders based on their file extensions. This script categorizes files into Images, Documents, Audio, Videos, and Scripts.
- [System Health Monitoring](./system-health-monitoring/)
The `system-health-monitoring.py` script monitors system health and performance metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and disk space. It logs these metrics to a text file or CSV file.
